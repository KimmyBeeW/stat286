## My Hobbies
One of my hobbies is learning instruments, and most recently I'm learning how to play the ocarina.
I also love: learning to code, playing video games with my husband, reading fairytales, and going on walks.

## Hello World
Here is the code for Hello World in Python:
```{python}
print("Hello World")
```

Here is the code for Hello World in R (same thing):
```{r}
print("Hello World")
```
